    "The two most common types of data encountered in typical data science workflows are tabular (columnar) datasets and raster (array) data. In the Python ecosystem, the former type of data has gradually standardized around the pandas [DataFrame API](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) while raster data has standarized around the [NumPy API](https://numpy.org/).\n",

For array data, you can use [XArray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) to specify labelled multidimensional arrays or [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is available as part of an `anaconda project` archive that you can download [here](https://anaconda.org/jlstevens/project/exploring-data). If you extract the archive, you will also find a notebook called `Reproducibly_Capturing_Code.ipynb` which details the steps needed to set up the  environment necessary to run this notebook. More information can be found in the *Capturing your Python code as a reproducible, deployable project* companion talk.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will see how [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) allows you to visualize data in all these various formats using a `.plot` style API inspired by [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Our first step is therefore to take a look at some simple examples of what you can do with `.plot` on a pandas `DataFrame` without `hvplot`, starting with a pandas import:"
